# Project Overview: 

This project generates a .jef file which programs an embroidery machine to stitch the Koch snowflake onto a piece of felt or clothing. The stitching is done with hashed - criss cross pattern that ensures a high quality stitch. The program additionaly runs a second time, criss crossing in the opposite manner. With this, two different strands of string could be encorperated to result in a more asthetic stitch. The overstitching further adds to the quality of stitch. 

# Files Included: 
              
 * sewing.py
      
# Model Generation Instructions:

* This project requires a programmable embroidery machine. 
* The attatched python file will generate a .jef file which can be used to run the embroidery machine.

# Additional Comments:

This program is meant for the embroidery machine availible at Columbia University. Results could vary depending on the machine being used. The thickness of the felt, as well as the quality of the stitching being used are also important considerations when embroidering a piece of clothing.
